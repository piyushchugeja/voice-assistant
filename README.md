  Voice assistant using Python
</h2>
The voice assistant <b>Alice</b> is built using the following libraries<br>

- `speech_recognition`
- `gtts`
- `openai`
- `playsound`

The voice assistant is hard-coded for a few tasks such as telling jokes, fetching details about personalities from wikipedia, searching for content using a browser, etc.
For the tasks which aren't included in the code, it uses the ``OpenAI API`` to fetch the answers for the user's commands.
